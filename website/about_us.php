<label>Our main motive is to aware the students about the education culture now a days.Basically, many universities are launched in India with a motive
just to earn profit inpite with a thought to educate the present generation and provide quality education to them.Such Universities are now categorised under 
Blacklisted Universities by government of India.The proper inspection have been launched in India inorder to bug such illegal and profit earning universities and 
hence made a strict action upon it.The government of India has also initiated some plan to protect the students from getting admitted into such universities.
<br><br>
Hence,we have listed those black listed as well as legal as well as top ranking universities to help students in choosing correct decession for their
future.Assessing the quality of education brings to the fore a number of issues. One issue that emerges when assessing any form of quality education is defining 
what counts as quality. Another issue involves who the quality is intended for â€“ the users, audience or stakeholders? A further issue is the form of assessment 
used, who conducts the measurement and the assessment, and what the results are used for. Measuring education quality is complex and involves an understanding of
 the history of science, the development of information and web technologies, the increasing importance of the knowledge-based economy, the rise of global science,
  and the corresponding 
increasing imperative field by higher education institutions and governments to find ways of measuring and benchmarking education quality.
<br><br>
Institutions may implement schemes or evaluation mechanisms to identify and promote good teaching practices. The institutional environment of higher education 
institutions can also lead to enhancement of quality of the teaching in higher education through various means. Higher education is becoming a major driver of 
economic competitiveness in an increasingly
 knowledge-driven global economy. The imperative for countries to improve employment skills calls for quality teaching within educational institutions.
 <br><br>Institutions want to be recognized as providers of good quality higher education. They understand that competing on the basis of research only is not sufficient
  to ensure the reputation of the university. As such, they want to find new ways of demonstrating performance. They respond to students demand for valuable teaching: students want to ensure
   that their education will lead to jobs and will give them the skills needed in the society of today and tomorrow. Mobility of students and growth of fees
    increase the consideration given by students to the quality of the teaching.

Assessment is a central element in the overall quality of teaching and learning in higher education. Well-designed assessment sets clear expectations, establishes
 a reasonable workload and provides opportunities for students to self-monitor, rehearse, practice and receive feedback. Assessment is an integral component of a 
 coherent educational experience.<br><br>
The relationship between assessment practices and the overall quality of teaching and learning is often underestimated, yet assessment requirements and the 
clarity of assessment criteria and standards significantly influence the effectiveness of student learning. Carefully designed assessment contributes directly
 to the way students approach their study and therefore contributes indirectly, but powerfully, to the quality of their learning.<br><br>
